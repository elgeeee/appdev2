## 1. What went well
- Last semester, I felt confident working on basic web development tasks, especially when creating simple web pages using HTML and CSS. 

- I was comfortable designing layouts, organizing content, and applying basic styling to make pages look clean and readable.

- I also gained confidence in following instructions, checking errors, and fixing simple issues on my own.

## 2. What went wrong / Challenges
- I sometimes struggled when codes did not work as expected, especially during debugging. Understanding errors took time, and I needed to recheck lessons.

- During projects, one challenge I faced was time management. Balancing different subjects while working on app development tasks was hard at times. There were also moments when teamwork became challenging because of different ideas, schedules, or uneven contributions.

## 3. Key Learnings
- I learned how to use React and how helpful it is in building web applications. I also understood how planning the app structure is important to avoid errors and confusion during development.

- I also developed important soft skills such as problem-solving, adaptability, and collaboration. I learned how to adjust when things did not work as expected, manage my tasks better, and work more effectively with a team through clear communication and shared responsibility.

## 4. Areas for Improvement
- I want to focus more on improving my backend skills and logic building. I want to be more confident when handling errors, databases, and application flow. I also want to practice more so I can work faster and more efficiently.

- To improve my contribution in team projects, I plan to communicate more actively, manage my tasks better, and offer help when possible.

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)
- For AppDev2, my goal is to better understand mobile application development. I want to learn how to design functional and user-friendly mobile apps.

- I hope to receive clear explanations, step-by-step examples, and enough hands-on activities. Guidance during difficult topics and feedback on our work will really help me keep up and stay motivated throughout the semester.
